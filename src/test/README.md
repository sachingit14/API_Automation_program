# REST Assured Learning Repository

This repository contains a complete learning journey of **API testing with REST Assured** in Java.
It covers everything from the **basics** to **advanced features**, including CRUD operations, TestNG integration, Allure reporting, and data-driven testing.

## ðŸ“š Overview

In this repository, we will be:

* Learning the **basics of REST Assured**.
* Writing programs to make:

    * **GET** requests
    * **POST** requests
    * **PUT** requests
    * **PATCH** requests
    * **DELETE** requests
* Performing **CRUD operations** on APIs.
* Understanding how to use REST Assured **effectively** with **TestNG**.
* Generating **Allure Reports** for better test visualization.
* Implementing **Data-Driven Testing** using **Apache POI** and related libraries.
